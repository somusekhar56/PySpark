# PySpark:

# 1. Introduction to PySpark:
# 1.1 PySpark Overview:
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, used to process large datasets in a distributed computing environment.It allows you to write Spark applications using Python instead of Scala/Java.
# It is commonly used for:
* Big data processing
  
* Distributed computing
  
* ETL pipelines
  
* Data analytics
# It supports:
* Spark SQL
  
* Spark MLib
  
* Dataframe
  
* RDD

 #  Key Features of PySpark
  | Feature                    | Explanation                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Distributed Processing** | Processes huge datasets across many machines |
| **In-memory computation**  | Faster than traditional Hadoop MapReduce     |
| **Fault tolerance**        | Data is replicated → no data loss            |
| **Scalable**               | Works on 1 machine or 1000 machines          |
| **Supports multiple APIs** | RDD, DataFrame, SQL, MLlib, Streaming        |
